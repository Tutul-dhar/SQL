## NOTE

A subquery is a query inside another query. It is enclosed in parentheses and used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query.

ðŸ”¹ Subqueries can be used in:

âœ” SELECT statements

âœ” WHERE clauses

âœ” FROM clauses

âœ” HAVING clauses

### ðŸ“Œ 1. Subquery in WHERE Clause

Find users whose salary is higher than the average salary:

        SELECT name, salary 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery calculates the average salary.
- The main query selects users with salaries above that average.
  
### ðŸ“Œ 2. Subquery in SELECT Statement

Find each employeeâ€™s salary and how it compares to the companyâ€™s average salary:

        SELECT name, salary, 
                (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS avg_salary
        FROM employees;

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery calculates the average salary.
- The main query retrieves each employeeâ€™s salary alongside the average salary.

### ðŸ“Œ 3. Subquery in FROM Clause (Derived Table)

Find employees with the highest salary per department:

        SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS highest_salary 
        FROM (SELECT department, salary FROM employees) AS temp_table
        GROUP BY department;

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery (temp_table) extracts department and salary.
- The main query groups data by department and finds the maximum salary.

### ðŸ“Œ 4. Subquery in HAVING Clause

Find departments where the average salary is greater than the overall company average salary

        SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary 
        FROM employees 
        GROUP BY department 
        HAVING AVG(salary) > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);



ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery finds the overall average salary.
- The main query filters departments where the average is higher than that value.

### ðŸ“Œ 5. EXISTS vs. IN in Subqueries

âœ… Using IN (for Matching a List)

Find employees working in departments where at least one person earns more than $100,000:

        SELECT name, department 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE department IN (SELECT department FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000);

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery gets departments with a salary over $100,000.
- The main query retrieves employees only in those departments.

âœ… Using EXISTS (for Checking Existence)

Find employees who have at least one bonus recorded in another table:

        SELECT name 
        FROM employees e
        WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM bonuses b WHERE b.employee_id = e.id);

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery checks if a matching employee_id exists in the bonuses table.
- The main query selects only employees with a recorded bonus.

### ðŸ“Œ 6. ANY and ALL with Subqueries

âœ… Using ANY (At Least One Match)
Find employees whose salary is greater than at least one manager's salary:

        SELECT name, salary 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE role = 'Manager');

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery gets all manager salaries.
- The main query finds employees with salaries greater than at least one manager.

âœ… Using ALL (Greater Than All)

Find employees earning more than all managers:

        SELECT name, salary 
        FROM employees 
        WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE role = 'Manager');

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- The subquery gets all manager salaries.
- The main query finds employees earning more than the highest manager salary.


### ðŸš€ Summary

âœ” Subqueries are used to nest one query inside another

âœ” Commonly used in WHERE, SELECT, FROM, and HAVING clauses

âœ” Can be used with IN, EXISTS, ANY, and ALL for flexible filtering

âœ” Performance Tip: Use JOIN instead of subqueries when possible for better efficiency
